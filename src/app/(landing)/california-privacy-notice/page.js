                            use commercially reasonable efforts to correct the inaccurate

                            allows or requires us to refrain from acting in response to your
                            request. We may not accommodate a request to change information if
                            we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or
                            cause the information to be incorrect. It is important to note that
                            any request for correction is limited by the legal rights of

                            <li>
                                Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to
                                properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.{" "}
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal
                            information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make
                            the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.
                            Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create
                            an account with us. We will only use personal information provided
                            in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity
                            or authority to make the request. We may request a copy of your
                            government issued identification to verify you are the person whose
                            information we collected, or their authorized representative.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Response Timing and Format</h4>
                        <p>
                            We will confirm receipt of your request within fourteen (14)
                            business days. We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer
                            request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up
                            to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period
                            in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our
                            written response to that account. If you do not have an account with
                            us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically,
                            at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the
                            12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt.
                            The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot
                            comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests,
                            we will select a format to provide your personal information that is
                            readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information
                            from one entity to another entity without hindrance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable
                            consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly
                            unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will
                            tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost
                            estimate before completing your request.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Do Not Sell or Share My Information</h4>
                        <p>
                            You have the right to opt of the sale of your personal information
                            to a third party. Effective January 1, 2023, you have the right to
                            opt out and request your personal information not be shared with
                            third parties for those third parties’ behavioral advertising
                            purposes. Please note that this does not stop Jetquin Travels from
                            distributing this information within our organization across
                            business units. Additionally, your right to opt out does not stop
                            all transfers to third parties as we can continue to provide your
                            personal information to our service providers pursuant to a written
                            contract that meets requirements within the CCPA. Furthermore, we
                            can continue to provide data that does not meet the definition of
                            personal information.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This right to opt out applies to all California consumers ages 16 or
                            older and may be exercised at any time. We will honor all such
                            requests unless you subsequently decide to opt-in to the sale of
                            your personal information. We do not sell the personal information
                            of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless
                            we receive affirmative authorization (the "right to opt-in") from
                            either the consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the
                            parent or guardian of a consumer less than 13 years of age.
                            Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of
                            future sales at any time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The sale of personal information does not include if you direct
                            Jetquin Travels to interact with a third party, Jetquin Travels alerts third
                            parties that you have opted out, the sharing of information is
                            necessary to perform a business purpose and meets the other
                            conditions specified, or the information is transferred as part of
                            an asset in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other change of
                            control of Jetquin Travels.

                            Separate from the CCPA and CPRA, California residents also have the
                            right to ask companies what personal information they share with
                            third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes
                            under California’s Shine the Light law. We do not disclose your
                            personal information to third parties to enable them to directly
                            market their goods or services to you unless you request such
                            disclosure.
