                            Most of the airline tickets and service fees charged for booking the
                            same are non-refundable after 24 hours of booking. In case of hotel
                            bookings, the amount paid is non-refundable under any circumstance.
                            However, the service fees charged for making hotel bookings may be

                            All cancelations pertaining to airline tickets, hotel bookings need
                            to be done over the phone only. We will only accept refund request

                                    If you are not a "no show." No show refers to the situation
                                    where a passenger at the time of boarding is not present and
                                    provides no information regarding the same to the airline. In
                                    most scenarios, a "no show" booking is ineligible for any waiver
                                    from supplier with regard to refund processing.

                                    We are in the position to secure waivers from suppliers for
                                    processing the requested cancelation and refund.

                            the time that may require to process the requested refund. All the
                            refund requests go through a stringent sequential format. Once, the
                            request for cancelation has been placed with our customer service
                            agent, you will then be sent an e-mail notification from our end
                            stating that the request has been received. However, receiving a
                            notification does not qualify for a refund. The e-mail notification
                            is just an acknowledgment that your request has been received and
                            provides you with a tracking number. On receiving your request for
                            cancelation and refund, we will contact the suppliers such as
                            airlines, hotels and car rental companies to generate a waiver if it
                            at all qualifies for a refund. The decision of the supplier shall
                            prevail and we shall notify you about it.
                        </p>

                            on the suppliersâ€™ decision for receiving the requested refunds.
                            Please note that refunds are only possible if airline/supplier rules
                            permit such refunds. Once the requested refund has been approved by
                            the supplier, it may take about 60-90 days; from receiving your

                            processed by the supplier, then in that case we will refund you the
                            post-ticketing service fees charged by us. However this does not
                            apply to our booking fees for the original travel reservation or
                            booking.
