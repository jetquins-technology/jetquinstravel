                            If you decide to seek arbitration, you must first send, by certified
                            mail, a written Notice of Dispute ("Notice") addressed to:
                            Jetquin Travels, 25 Creekside Court, Secaucus, New Jersey 07094, United
                            States. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the
                            Claim; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If the Company
                            and you, or the Company and any Third-party, do not reach an
                            agreement to resolve the Claim within 60 days after the Notice is
                            received, you, or the Third-party, may commence an arbitration
                            proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement
                            offer made shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the
                            arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you, any
                            Third-party, or the Company is entitled.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The arbitration shall be held at a location determined by AAA
                            pursuant to the Rules and Procedures (provided that such location is
                            reasonably convenient for you, or any Third-party asserting a
                            Claim), or at such other location as may be mutually agreed upon.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To the extent that any Claim is held not to be subject to
                            arbitration and proceeds in a Court other than small claims court,
                            such Claim shall be filed only in the United States District Court
                            Located in the central New Jersey area or, if there is no federal
                            jurisdiction over the action, in the courts of the State of New
                            Jersey located in Camden County, New Jersey. You hereby consent and
                            submit to the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes
                            of litigating any such Claim that is not subject to the arbitration
                            provision and not pursued in small claims court, and agree that any
                            such claim shall be resolved individually, without resort to any
                            form of class action. You further agree that any and all Claims or
                            other matters asserted in such dispute, whether based upon contract,
                            tort, statute, or otherwise, shall be governed by the laws of the
                            State of New Jersey, without regard to conflict of laws provisions
                            that would result in the application of the laws of any other
                            jurisdiction.

                            (EITHER ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC OR OTHER USERS OR PERSONS).
                            ANY AND ALL PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE CLAIMS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON
                            AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. IN ADDITION, NO ARBITRATION PROCEEDING UNDER
                            THIS PROVISION SHALL BE CONSOLIDATED OR JOINED IN ANY WAY WITH ANY
                            OTHER ARBITRATION PROCEEDING WITHOUT THE EXPRESS WRITTEN CONSENT OF
                            ALL PARTIES. If you are unable to pay the filing fee, the Company
                            will pay it for you.

                            Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any of the Rules and
                            Procedures established by AAA which may be to the contrary, the
                            Company will not be entitled to seek reimbursement of its attorney's
                            fees for any Claim the arbitrator finds to be non-frivolous.

                            With the exception of the class action waiver, above, if any part of
                            this arbitration provision is held to be invalid, unenforceable or
                            illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the Rules and Procedures
                            established by AAA, then the balance of this arbitration provision
                            shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its
                            terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting
                            provision were not contained herein. If, however, the class action
                            waiver, above, is held to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then
                            the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void,
                            and neither you nor any Third-party, nor the Company shall be
                            entitled to arbitrate their dispute.

                            According to the Department of Transportation’s website:
                            disinsection is permitted under international law in order to
                            protect public health, agriculture and the environment. The World
                            Health Organization and the International Civil Aviation
                            Organization stipulate two approaches for aircraft disinsection: (1)
                            spray the aircraft cabin, with an aerosolized insecticide, while
                            passengers are on board or (2) spray or treat the aircraft's
                            interior surfaces with a residual insecticide (residual method)
                            while passengers are not on board. American Samoa has adopted a
                            third method, in which aircraft are sprayed with an aerosolized
                            insecticide while passengers are not on board. Although the Report
                            of the Informal Consultation on Aircraft Disinsection sponsored by
                            the World Health Organization (November 6-10, 1995) concluded that
                            aircraft disinsection, if performed appropriately, would not present
                            a risk to human health. The report also noted that some individuals
                            may experience transient discomfort following aircraft disinsection
                            by aerosol application. Under the Chicago Convention, which governs
                            international civil aviation, a country could impose a disinsection
                            requirement should it perceive a threat to its public health,
                            agriculture or environment. Accordingly, you should check with your
                            travel agent or airline reservations agent when booking flights or
                            if you have questions about your final destination’s policy. For

                            contacts for disinsection and a list of countries that require
                            disinsection, please visit the Department of Transportation’s

                            you select to make the purchase. You will be charged in the currency
                            shown upon checkout. If you use a debit or credit card to make a
                            purchase through the Website, please note that, due to fluctuations

                            the use of third party application program interfaces or such other
                            methods as we may later designate. In the event we determine we must

                            transactions, without limitation for international transactions.
                            Your bank may convert the payment amount to your local currency and
                            charge you a conversion fee. This means the amount listed on your
                            credit or bank card statement may be in your local currency and
                            therefore a different figure than the figure shown on the billing
                            summary page for a reservation booked on the Website. In addition, a
                            foreign transaction fee may be assessed without limitation if the
                            bank that issued your credit card is located outside of the United
                            States of America. Booking international travel may be considered to
                            be an international transaction by the bank or card company. The
                            currency exchange rate and foreign transaction fee is determined
                            solely by your bank. If you have any questions about these fees or
                            the exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.

                            Promo codes are applicable on flight bookings only. Promo codes need
                            to be applied at the time of checking out. The promo codes displayed

                            marketing platforms offer discounts on our service fees. Promo codes

                            codes may be withdrawn, and the discount value can be changed
                            anytime without prior notice. These promo codes can only be applied
                            once by a single customer. The discount value will be calculated up
                            to the amount of the service fees charged for that particular
                            transaction or up to the promo code's value per transaction,

                            by the applicable airline, when issued, shall be between the
                            applicable airline and the passenger. Airlines retain the right to
                            adjust flight times and schedules at any time - schedule changes can
                            result in an itinerary that falls outside of the Company’s
                            contractual agreements. Airlines may also in their discretion change
                            or cancel flights or itineraries.

                            certain travel routes, the airline carrier selling or marketing the
                            flight does not actually fly its own aircraft to the destination;
                            instead, a partner airline is engaged via contract to fly to the

                            however, it is best to verify your flight check-in location with

                            Upon check-in, the holder of the reservation must provide a valid
                            identification and cash deposit, credit or debit card, as determined
                            by the hotel at the hotel’s sole discretion, in his or her name (the
                            amount of available credit required will vary by hotel). Depending
                            on the hotel’s policy, debit cards may not be accepted for this
                            purpose. Such deposit is unrelated to any payment received by
                            Company.

                            Hotel accommodation for more than two adults is not guaranteed, as
                            certain hotels do not allow additional guests. If the hotel at which
                            you made a reservation does allow additional guests, there may be
                            added charges. Such added charges vary and will be payable directly
                            to the hotel, not the Company.
                        </p>

                            {" "}
                            In the event you are delayed on your date of check-in or find that
                            you cannot check-in to your hotel on the date you requested, contact
                            the hotel directly to advise it of your travel changes. Depending on
                            the applicable hotel’s terms and conditions, if you do not check-in
                            to your hotel on the day of your reservation and also do not alert
                            the hotel, the hotel may cancel the remaining portion of your
                            reservation and may not provide you with a refund.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Changes to Your Reservation and Cancellations</h4>
                        <p>
                            There are various cancellation policies among hotels. Some
                            reservations are non-cancellable and cannot be altered. Other
                            reservations require a penalty payment for cancellation. Of course,
                            some reservations are fully refundable upon cancellation. You should
                            check your hotel’s cancellation policy before you book. If changes
                            to your pre-paid reservation are allowed by the hotel, such changes
                            or cancellation may only be permitted with a booking of a new
                            reservation with that hotel. You acknowledge that in no event will
                            Company be required to refund any amounts.{" "}

                        <h4>Disability</h4>
                        <p>
                            If you have disability needs (for example only: if you require the
                            use of a service animal), you should contact the hotel to verify
                            that your disability needs can be met by the hotel prior to booking
                            your reservation.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Hotel Accommodations and Special Requests</h4>
                        <p>
                            Depending on the hotel and reservation type, room or bed requests
                            may not be honored by the hotel. Typically, such assignments are
                            based on the hotel’s room and bed availability and are at the
                            hotel's sole discretion. We cannot make any guaranties with respect
                            to the room, bed or other preferences you may have and request (for
                            example, smoking or non-smoking). If you wish to make requests of
                            the hotel, you must contact the hotel and personally verify that
                            such requests can be met by the hotel. You acknowledge that the
                            Company has no control over such matters, and is unable to assist
                            you in this regard.

                            up or drop off the car late). Upon pick-up of the rental car, the
